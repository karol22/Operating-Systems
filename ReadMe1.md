To run this program, use a C++11 Compiler, for example, Code::Blocks.
IT ONLY WORKS FOR STRINGS THAT USE ASCII CHARACTERS AND THAT DOES NOT CONTAIN SPECIAL CHARACTERS NOR LINE BREAKS.
After running the program, it will ask you to provide the string to test.
Type your string and then press Enter.
After that, the program will tell you the first character that is not repeated in the string and also it will tell you the time spent.
In case that there's no character non-repeated, the program will tell you that.

Time complexity:
The time complexity is O(2n)=O(n) since it checks the string two times.
